# Input

User input is accepted by the software via HTTP requests.  When establishing a new user, people can transmit data in JSON format including `username` among other parameters.  API endpoints particularly built to handle GET and POST queries receive the input.

# Process

The software runs the data through Express.js and Mongoose upon getting the input.  The Express framework sends the requests to the relevant handlers, where Mongoose connects with the MongoDB database.  For example, the software checks the input, generates a new user document, and stores it to the database when a new user is added.  Errors during data processing are managed by means of error handling; examples include validation errors or database connection problems.

# Output

The program's output is produced in reaction to the user's needs.  Successful actions depend on the program's JSON answers showing the status of the request, such as a confirmation message for added users or a list of users fetched from the database.  Should mistakes occur, suitable error messages are sent back to notify the user of the problem.
